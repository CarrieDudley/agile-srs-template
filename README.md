# Agile Software Requirement Specifications
The agile software development process needs to be very nimble to the changes in the project requirements and scope. The documentation component of such process should be simple and should only cover the essentials. Modeling should be used to describe software components and processes, when possible. 


- This repo uses markdown and UML (for modeling) for documenting the software requirements. Dataflow diagrams will be used where flow of data needs to be communicated.
- I have used git for version management.
